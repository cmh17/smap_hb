title: "Rainfall Event Selection"
format: beamer
---

<!-- #
- do analysis with both streamflow and rainfall

- one big event in april of 2016

- don't really need to look at Harvey bc eventually if there's so much rainfall, then soil moisture doesn't matter

#
- look at moderate events where soil moisture antecedent conditions could make a difference

#
- one of the gages from the FWS has soil moisture

- good to look at the time series to plot for different rainfall magnitues, how long it takes soil moisture to go back

#
- look at peak in rainfall and peak in soil moisture: want to know if we have a significant rainfall event, how many days will the moisture stay in the soil?

- then if we have another rainfall event in the next seven
days, maybe there will be more of a likelihood of flooding

- if there are back-to-back events, pay special attention to those

#
- place to start: quantiles

- first filter out 80th percentile plus and then zoom in from there; get rid of like 95th percentile bc don't want super extreme

- contact True
- look at FWS gages -->

# Cypress Creek Watershed

# Cypress Creek Background

- 267 sq. mi, or about 700 km^2

- 250 mi open stream, or about 400 km

# Gages to collect data from

1185, 1180, 1175, 1170, 1165, 1150, 1140, 1130, 1120, 1115, 1110

Ones with soil saturation: 1185, 1170, 1140

- 1185 has soil saturation data from 2019-09-25

- 1170 has soil sat from 2021-02-12

- 1140 has soil sat from 2020-11-15

<!-- #

1. pick some rain events between 2015 and 2019
- a. try to find 3 events - they don't have to have caused widespread
flooding; just high flow/high rain events
- b. make slides showing results from analysis
2. get the model from True and try to run it
3. try to download some test data for our region -->

# Possible rainfall events

- 2019-10-29: 1.88 in, preceded by rainy days
- 2017-09-18: 1.64 in, first day of considerable rainfall after Harvey
- 2016-08-21: 1.44 in - a day of less rain following heavier rain in the past week
- 2015-05-27: 2.80 in - preceded by lots of moderate rain, maybe too high

# Gage 1185 rainfall and stage
![2015 rainfall and stage 1185](figures\rainfall_stage_2015.png){width=100%}

- 80th quantile is 0.88 in

- 95th quantile is 2.42 in

# Next steps

Getting model from True tomorrow
- Look at existing plans and try running

Look more closely at downstream gages for events of interest

# Next steps

Collect data for ML portion

- Dynamic
    * 50 km SMAP-HB
    * 30 m SMAP-HB
    * 0.1-deg IMERG precip.

- Static
    * NLCD 2016 land cover
    * POLARIS 30 m soil properties
    * USGS 30 m DEM

Do all data acquisiton by script; save as native format for now and review xarrays and tensorflow documentation
